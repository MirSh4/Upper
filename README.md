# Upper
This repository contains a custom implementation of the upper() method for strings in Python. The MyString class inherits from Python's built-in str class and overrides the upper() method to manually convert lowercase letters to uppercase without relying on the default implementation.

# MyString: Custom Upper Method Implementation

## Overview

This repository features a custom implementation of the `upper()` method in Python, encapsulated within a class called `MyString`. The `MyString` class inherits from Python's built-in `str` class and overrides the `upper()` method to manually convert all lowercase alphabetic characters to their uppercase counterparts.

## Features

- **Manual Uppercase Conversion**: The `upper()` method in `MyString` converts lowercase letters (a-z) to uppercase (A-Z) using ASCII values, without relying on Python's default `upper()` method.

Why Use This Implementation?
This custom upper() method is a simple demonstration of how string manipulation can be done manually in Python, offering an educational example of character encoding and method overriding.
